This C program creates a trie data structure to store a dictionary of words. It defines structures and functions to 
handle trie nodes, insertion, retrieval, and memory deallocation. The main function reads words from a file, constructs 
the trie, tests it with sample words, and then deallocates memory. Overall, the program efficiently manages and 
organizes words using the trie data structure. At the end of the execution, the code will display the number of
occurrences of each sample word in the trie.
